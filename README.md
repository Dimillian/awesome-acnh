## Tips

### General gameplay, quirks, and delights
* The following items retain their most recent customization even after the art in the custom design slot is deleted or changed: island flag, phone case, face paint.
* If you need to craft something on your island but you’re far from one of your own benches, try popping into one of your villager’s houses to see if their DIY Craft bench is out, or use the one by Tom Nook inside Resident Services!
* Weather changes only occur on the hour.
* You cannot give uprooted trees to another villager or player, nor store them in your house.
* You cannot give uprooted flowers to another villager or player, nor sell them, nor store them in your house. If you want to get rid of flowers in your pocket, you can permanently throw them out in a garbage can if you have one placed in your home or outside. 
* You can plant flowers in your pocket on another player’s island, even if you aren’t Best Friends.
* If you’ve eaten more fruit than you’d like, try sitting on a toilet.
* If you place more than one stereo in a room in your house, it will amplify the registered song.
* Each stereo placed outside can play a different registered song, but you‘ll only hear the closest one. Your villagers will pay attention to music they hear!
* If you create outfits with a Wand, the wearable items in the outfits are “stored” in the Wand and are unusable in other outfits.
* The exception to a new day’s changes occuring at 5:00 am (see: [Timing](#timing)) are critters appearing or disappearing at the start of a new month. These changes occur at midnight when the local date changes.

### Visiting other islands
* Don’t run through flowers. It takes time for the blooms to grow back. Be sure to walk wherever you see flowers.
* Don’t leave by pressing the <kbd>-</kbd> button. It will interrupt the progress of every other visitor’s interactions. 
* Ask before you buy one of the 2-3 furniture items at the back wall of Nook’s Cranny or art from Jolly Redd. These items can only be purchased once, so it’s polite to ask if it’s okay for you to buy it. (The small items on the table at Nook’s and furniture from Jolly Redd have no purchase limit. And you can always offer to let the island owner catalog the Nook’s item!)
* Don’t shake trees, chop wood, grab shells, pick flowers, etc. without asking first. Most friends will be totally okay with you taking replenishable resources, but it’s always polite to ask.
* If you’re visiting a stranger for a trade, it’s polite not to talk to their residents. Villagers will remember you and ask about you, and it can be awkward and unwanted for a neighbor to ask about a stranger that came by for a deal!
* Unlike Sahara, Leif, Kicks, etc., you can only buy one piece of art from any Jolly Redd per day and obtain one recipe from any Celeste per night.
* If you’re visiting an island for a particular recipe a villager is crafting at their DIY bench, check the map on your NookPhone to see where their house is!
* Download the [Nintendo Switch Online app](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/online-service/app/) for your phone to use the NookLink feature to type messages in-game using your phone’s keyboard instead of the game controller.

## Timing
Time is determined by your Nintendo Switch’s local time. Though midnight local time changes the date, a new “day” in ACNH officially starts at 🕔 **`5:00 am`**, when daily announcements are made on your island, dailies “refill”, visitors arrive/leave, and projects make progress.

## Tool durability
Tools only wear down when your action is successful. Ladders, Vaulting Poles, and Wands will not break. Watering empty land decreases a Watering Can’s durability by 10% of its use on flower(s). <sup>[`source`](https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-acnh-guide/2020/3/31/21194209/durability-list-broken-breaking-shovel-axe-fishing-rod-watering-can-slingshot-bug-net)</sup>
