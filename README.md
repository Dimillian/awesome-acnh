## Tips

### General gameplay, quirks, and delights
* If you need to craft something on your island but you’re far from one of your own benches, try popping into one of your villager’s houses to see if their DIY Craft bench is out, or use the one by Tom Nook inside Resident Services!
* If you are physically sharing your Nintendo Switch, the first account to play the game owns the island and dictates initial progress.
* If you want to get rid of an item in your pocket and cannot re-sell it or give it away, you can permanently throw them out in a garbage can if you have one placed in your home or outside.

#### Flora
* Palm trees only grow in sand (either from your beaches or a sand path via the Island Designer NookPhone app).
* You cannot give uprooted flowers or trees to another villager or player, nor store them in your house. 
* You may plant uprooted flowers in your pocket on another player’s island, even if you aren’t Best Friends.
* Trees can be uprooted by eating food and using your shovel to dig up the tree.
* Trees need at least 1 empty space in all directions around them to grow. Once a tree is fully grown, it can be moved to be closer to other objects (other trees, furniture, flowers, fencing, etc.) by uprooting it and replanting it.

#### Time
* Weather changes only occur on the hour.
* The exception to a new day’s changes occuring at 5:00 am (see: [Timing](#timing)) are critters appearing or disappearing at the start of a new month. These changes occur at midnight when the local date changes.

#### Eating
* If you eat food before you hit a stone, it will break. The stone will reappear a new area the following day.
* If you’ve eaten more food than you’d like, try sitting on a toilet.

#### Music
* If you place more than one stereo in a room in your house, it will amplify the registered song.
* Each stereo placed outside can play a different registered song, but you‘ll only hear the closest one. Your villagers will pay attention to music they hear!
* Your villagers will be interested in instruments placed outside.

#### Clothing and designs
* If you create outfits with a Wand, the wearable items in the outfits are “stored” in the Wand and are unusable in other outfits.
* The following items retain their most recent customization even after the art in the custom design slot is deleted or changed: island flag, phone case, face paint.

### Visiting other islands
* Don’t run through flowers. It takes time for the blooms to grow back. Be sure to walk wherever you see flowers.
* Don’t leave by pressing the <kbd>-</kbd> button. It will interrupt the progress of every other visitor’s interactions. 
* Ask before you buy one of the 2-3 furniture items at the back wall of Nook’s Cranny or art from Jolly Redd. These items can only be purchased once, so it’s polite to ask if it’s okay for you to buy it. (The small items on the table at Nook’s and furniture from Jolly Redd have no purchase limit. And you can always offer to let the island owner catalog the Nook’s item!)
* Don’t shake trees, chop wood, grab shells, pick flowers, etc. without asking first. Most friends will be totally okay with you taking replenishable resources, but it’s always polite to ask.
* If you’re visiting a stranger for a trade, it’s polite not to talk to their residents. Villagers will remember you and ask about you, and it can be awkward and unwanted for a neighbor to ask about a stranger that came by for a deal!
* Unlike Sahara, Leif, Kicks, etc., you can only buy one piece of art from any Jolly Redd per day and obtain one recipe from any Celeste per night.
* Adding a player to your Best Friends list via the NookPhone means you can use your shovel and axe tools on their island.
* If you’re visiting an island for a particular recipe a villager is crafting at their DIY bench, check the map on your NookPhone to see where their house is!
* Download the [Nintendo Switch Online app](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/online-service/app/) for your phone to use the NookLink feature to type messages in-game using your phone’s keyboard instead of the game controller.

## Timing
Time is determined by your Nintendo Switch’s local time. Though midnight local time changes the date, a new “day” in ACNH officially starts at 🕔 **`5:00 am`**, when daily announcements are made on your island, dailies “refill”, visitors arrive/leave, and projects make progress.

## NPC visitors
<sup>⚠️ <em>Potential spoiler content!</em></sup> 
 
Your island will receive regular visitors a few times a week. All visitors arrive at `5:00 am` and will stay until `5:00 am` the next day unless otherwise stated. <sup><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-8kQMnmduhraliqCrehaAviG0qlm5BnAb73rPPOf-z0/preview#"><code>source</code></a></sup>

| Visitor | Location | Arrives | Departs | Day of week |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Wisp | roaming cliffs | 8:00 pm 🌙 | | |
| Sahara | roaming | | midnight 🌙 | |
| Daisy Mae | roaming | | 12:00 pm ☀️ | Sunday only |
| CJ | roaming | | | except Saturday |
| Flick | roaming | | | except Saturday |
| Gulliver | beach | | | except Saturday |

### Wisp
After you complete Wisp’s quest you can choose between two options:

* **Something you don’t have yet**: Wisp will pick a random item that you don’t have in your Nook Shopping list worth ≤1,500 Bells or less. If your catalog is complete, a random item worth ≤1,500 bells. Once your house is upgraded from a tent, you have the following chances of item type:
  * Furniture: 40%
  * Wallpaper/Flooring: 24%
  * Bed: 24%
  * Clothing: 12%
* **Something expensive**: Wisp will pick an item with a buying price of ≤10,000 Bells.

## Lost items
Occasionally you’ll find an item on the ground that isn’t your standard weeds or tree branches! When you pick it up, you’ll find this is a **Lost item** and it belongs to one of your villagers. Selecting <kbd>Investigate</kbd> on the item in your inventory will allow you to see additional information to better determine who the item belongs to based on their personality type. If you return the lost item to the correct villager on the first try, you will receive a better reward. <sup>[`source`](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dCaPo6N-9XDwOQYMmvv9R7HPqvXPGUF5B6frZs0fcms/edit#gid=0)</sup>

If you get the message “Someone lost this…”, then the lost item belongs to a villager below favor level 3 (0-59 friendship points).

| Personality | Book | Notebook | Bag 1 | Bag 2 | 
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Lazy** | A well-used, well-loved picture book. There are little broken bits of candy between the pages… | This looks like someone’s diary. Is this stain from drool? Maybe they fell asleep on it while writing. | This pouch is stuffed with something that smells delicious and is probably full of sugar. | This pouch looks like it’s starting to tear in places. It’s a little sticky too. Did someone spill juice on it?|
| **Jock** | This book is hard to read. The pages are warped, like they’ve gotten wet before. I think it’s an exercise book. | Somebody scribbled something on the cover in pencil. Looks like it reads, “xtreme xercises”? | A very simple bag… that’s a tad open. I spot some gym clothes, I think. | A dusty, well-used bag. It vaguely smells like those minty sports creams that athletes use. | 
| **Cranky** | There are lots of pictures of potted trees inside. It looks like an introductory guide to bonsai trees. | An old planner that’s seen plenty of wear and tear. The last page has tally marks… They are up to 12 now. | A sturdy, old-fashioned sort of bag. It gets full points for utility and zero points for style. | This classic pouch was built with functionality in mind, nothing more. It’s the work of a craftsman. Maybe. | 
| **Smug** | It’s a novel. The author was obviously trying to be fancy by using lots of foreign words. I don’t get it. | The cover of the book says “Mi diario secreto.” I get the feeling I shouldn’t look inside. | It’s a stylish bag. The complex design says more about style than it does about function. | A stylish bag that looks like it could be popular. Whether it actually is popular might depend on the owner… |
| **Normal** | This novel looks really difficult. It’s the kind of book only a voracious reader would think to pick up. | It reads "My Journal" in tiny letters on the cover. It’s hard not to, but I probably shouldn’t peek inside. | An adorable handcrafted bag with something hard and rectangular inside. Maybe it’s a book? | A bag with a simple design. I can tell it was painstakingly made by hand. |
| **Peppy** |It’s a comic. There’s a girl with big, sparkling eyes on the cover. She’s probably the hero. | It’s an autograph book, but it’s covered with all kinds of sparkly stickers. It’s making my eyes hurt. | A bag made from a soft printed fabric featuring cartoon characters. It’s all lumpy from being packed too full.| A snappy bag covered with buttons and pins of different pop stars. | 
| **Snooty** | It’s one of those love stories that are so popular nowadays. It has a subtle aroma too. Or is that my imagination?|I think it’s a personal planner. Every line is filled in with precise, perfect handwriting. Err… I should close this. | Maybe this is someone’s makeup bag? It smells like lovely perfume. | A pretty bag that’s been well-loved. It looks like it’s been customized a number of times. |
| **Big Sister** | A book with pressed flowers inside. OH! It still has the price sticker on it! | This looks like somebody’s notebook. The handwriting is mostly illegible, but I can make out the word “Band.” | A stylish bag adorned with gold metal spikes. It’s got attitude! | The front of the bag has embroidered lettering in gold thread. The words are… “Bikers Are More Fun.” | 

## Tool durability
Tools only wear down when your action is successful. Ladders, Vaulting Poles, and Wands will not break. Watering empty land decreases a Watering Can’s durability by 10% of its use on flower(s). <sup>[`source`](https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-acnh-guide/2020/3/31/21194209/durability-list-broken-breaking-shovel-axe-fishing-rod-watering-can-slingshot-bug-net)</sup>
